Q3]
a.2) The "Wins/Nominations Vs. Rating" feature is clearly the much better choice, since there the data is clearly separated,
and not concentrated at the base like the "Budget" Vs. "Rating" graph. We can make a much clearer distinction between the red and the blue points
in the "Wins/Nominations Vs. Rating" since there appears to be lesser merging of their domains.

Q3]
c) Advantage of using square-root and log scales:
When our data has a lot of data-points lying in the lower values, and a moderate number of points in the higher values, these scales help us
better distinguish the points in the lower values. The log scale creates a wider distinction for these lower value points than square-root scale.
